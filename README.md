# Smartphone-Details-Analysis-EDA-

Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis of Smartphone_Details_Analysis.

Overview: This notebook explores a dataset containing detailed attributes of various smartphones, focusing on uncovering insights from features like price, brand, battery capacity, performance benchmarks, and more. It employs Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib to manipulate data and visualize trends.

Key Insights (Assumed from Typical EDA Flow):
Brand Trends: Visualizations likely reveal which smartphone brands dominate specific market segments (e.g., budget vs flagship).
Battery vs Performance: A Countplot and bar plot could illustrate how battery capacity correlates with performance or price.
Price Distribution: Histograms and box plots might show pricing outliers and typical ranges across different brands.
Feature Impact: Regression plots may highlight how RAM, storage, or camera specs influence pricing or user preference.
Top Performers: Bar charts or rankings could identify the best value-for-money phones or most balanced options.

Tech Stack:
pandas for data manipulation
matplotlib & seaborn for visual storytelling

Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

Outcome: This EDA provides a foundation for further steps such as building a smartphone recommender system, performing sentiment analysis on user reviews, or deploying a pricing prediction model.
